[[Captions/Subtitles]](/media/av/captions/)
: Provide captions (also called “subtitles”) so that people who are Deaf and hard-of-hearing get a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the content.

[[Audio Description of Visual Information]](/media/av/description/)
: Provide description so that people who are blind and others who cannot see the video adequately get the visual information needed to understand the content. This includes things like charts, graphs, and text such as speaker names, titles, and e-mail addresses.

[[Transcripts]](/media/av/transcripts/)
: Provide a transcript, that is, a text version of the speech and non-speech audio information. Ideally, make it a descriptive transcript that also includes text description of the visual information. Descriptive transcripts are required to provide video content to people who are both Deaf and blind. ([descriptive transcript excerpt example](/WAI/media/av/transcripts/#descriptive))

[[Audio Content and Video Content]](/media/av/av-content/)
: When planning, scripting, storyboarding, recording, and producing media:
* Create high-quality audio and use low background noise.
* Speak clearly and slowly, and use clear language.
* Make any text readable, with good contrast and text size.
* Plan for audio description of visual information.


[[Media Players]](/media/av/player/)
: Use a media player that supports accessibility.

[[Planning Audio and Video Media]](/media/av/planning/)
: Plan for accessibility from the very start of your project, to save time and money. For example, [integrated description](/media/av/av-content/#integrate-description) is easier and better for accessibility, and it needs to be included in the script before filming.
