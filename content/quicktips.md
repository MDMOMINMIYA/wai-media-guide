* **[Plan](/media/av/planning/) for accessibility from the very start** of your project (before recording), to save time and money.
* **Make [audio and video content](/media/av/av-content/) accessible**. Avoid accessibility barriers when scripting, storyboarding, and recording content.
* **Use a [media player](/media/av/player/) that supports accessibility**.
* **[Describe visual information](/media/av/player/)** -- such as charts and speakers’ names in text -- so that people who are blind and others who cannot see the video get the visual information needed to understand the content.
* **Provide [captions](/media/av/captions/)** (called “**subtitles**” in some areas) so that people who are Deaf or hard-of-hearing get a synchronized text version of the speech and other audio information needed to understand the content.
* **Provide a [text transcript](/media/av/transcripts/)** from the caption text and the description of visual information so that people who are Deaf-blind get the video content.
* **Provide [sign language](/media/av/sign-languages/)** when possible, so that Deaf people whose native language is sign get the content in their language.
